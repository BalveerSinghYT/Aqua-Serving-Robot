Characterstics of our Aqua Serving Robot

- The Aqua Serving Robot is a robotic system that uses an Arduino microcontroller, ultrasonic sensor, IR sensor, and IR based encoder for navigation.
- The robot is designed to serve drinks or other beverages to users in a controlled environment, such as a restaurant or event venue.
- The ultrasonic sensor allow the robot to navigate around obstacles and avoid collisions, while the encoder helps it to follow a predetermined path.
- The project includes code and schematics for building and programming the robot, as well as documentation on how to use it.
- The Aqua Serving Robot is a fun and innovative way to automate the task of serving drinks, and could potentially be used in a variety of settings to improve efficiency and customer service.
